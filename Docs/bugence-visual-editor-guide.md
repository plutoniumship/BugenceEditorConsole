# Bugence Visual Editor — Quick Guide for Pete Dulcamara 🧭✨

## 1) Getting to the dashboard
1) In your browser, open your deployed site root (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`).  
2) In the address bar, append `/login` so it becomes `https://yourdomain.com/login`.  
3) Press Enter; this opens the Bugence Visual Editor login page.

## 2) Login details
- **Email:** `admin@bugence.com`  
- **Password:** 'Bugence!2025'

## 3) Editing pages in canvas mode (step-by-step, beginner friendly)
1) **Open the Library**  
   - From the dashboard home, click **Library** in the top bar, or use the **Library** item in the left sidebar.  
   - If you search from the dashboard, choose **Content/Library** from results to land on the page list.
2) **Pick the page card**  
   - Scroll the page cards (or search) until you see the page you want.  
   - Click the **Edit** action on that card to open the right sidebar panel.
3) **Launch canvas editing**  
   - In the sidebar panel (top), click **Edit in Canvas**.  
   - The page opens with the Visual Editor overlay.
4) **Interact in canvas**  
   - Hover blocks to see the orange outline; double‑click to open the editor popup.  
   - Sidebar and navbar areas are locked (view-only).  
   - Text: edit content/links, save, then publish.  
   - Images: upload, set alt text, save, then publish.

## 4) Resetting your password (OTP‑based)
1) On the login screen, click **Forgot password**.  
2) Enter your email `pete@petedulcamara.com`.  
3) You’ll receive a 1‑time OTP at that email (valid for 5 minutes).  
4) Enter the OTP; on success you’re taken to **Change Password**.  
5) Set a new password and confirm.  
6) Login with the new password.

### If you changed your password in Settings and forgot it later
- Use the same **Forgot password** flow above with the same email.  
- The OTP expires after 5 minutes; request a new one if it times out.

## 5) Publishing changes
- Edits save to draft. Click **Publish Live** in the right sidebar to push updates.  
- Confirm the publish; you’ll see a success toast when it’s live.
