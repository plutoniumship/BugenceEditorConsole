## Execution Summary
- Tasks I can begin immediately: **4** (`#5, #8, #10, #11`).
- Tasks I can complete after you provide information or assets: **3** (`#2, #3, #4`).
- Tasks that remain entirely with you or external accounts: **4** (`#1, #6, #7, #9`).

## Inputs Needed From You
- Verified business contact facts: primary email, phone, physical or service-area address, and social profiles.
- Operating hours, list of services (e.g., speaking engagements, community programs), and tone preferences for profile copy.
- Approved asset bundle: logo variants, cover art, author portraits, event imagery (ideally in 1200x900+, JPG/PNG).
- Confirmation of target site pages for SEO adjustments and schema integration.
- Access or approval workflow for publishing updated site metadata/content.

## Next Steps (Recommended)
1. Provide the outstanding business details and asset links so I can produce the GBP copy kit (`tasks #2–#4`).
2. Prioritise the website pages to optimise; I can then tackle metadata, structured data, and FAQ enhancements (`tasks #5, #8, #10, #11`).
3. After your Google accounts are ready, let me know if you’d like documented step-by-step guides for Search Console, Analytics, or citation outreach (`tasks #1, #6, #7, #9`).

## Google Business Profile Launch Steps (High-Tech Heroes)
1. Prep the account
   - Confirm which Google account will legally own the profile (recommend an organisational Google Workspace account, not a personal inbox).
   - Enable 2FA on the account and add a secondary recovery contact in case Google sends verification updates.
   - Collect official business details: `High-Tech Heroes`, primary email (`hello@hightechheroes.ai` placeholder—swap with the confirmed inbox), speaking+media phone line, and service-area or physical address for verification.
2. Gather publishing assets
   - Logo set (square 720×720 minimum, transparent background where possible).
   - Cover image (1200×900 minimum); recommended: Pete Dulcamara speaking photo or branded key visual.
   - Book/product imagery: High-Tech Heroes book cover, community shots, event imagery.
   - Author portrait of Pete Dulcamara with clean background.
   - Drafted business description (≤750 characters) highlighting author identity, sustainability keynote speaking, and book launch.
   - Service list: e.g., “Keynote Speaking”, “Corporate Innovation Workshops”, “High-Tech Heroes Book Launch Events”, “Community Partnerships”.
   - Links: website (`https://hightechheroes.ai`), LinkedIn, Goodreads, YouTube, podcast, booking page.
3. Create the Google Business Profile
   - Visit `https://www.google.com/business/` while signed in; choose “Add your business to Google”.
   - Business name: `High-Tech Heroes`.
   - Primary category: begin with `Author`. Secondary categories can be added after verification (e.g., `Marketing Consultant`, `Educational Consultant` if needed).
   - Address/Service area: if High-Tech Heroes is service-based, select “I deliver goods and services to my customers” and set regions (e.g., “United States” or specific cities). If there is a headquarters, input the physical location for stronger local relevance.
   - Contact details: add the dedicated phone number and main email; insert `https://hightechheroes.ai` as the website.
   - Choose verification method (postcard to HQ address or video verification). Submit request immediately to start the waiting period.
4. Complete the profile dashboard
   - Under “Info”, populate hours (if virtual, use “By appointment only”) and a short description (example draft: “High-Tech Heroes is Pete Dulcamara’s sustainability storytelling platform blending Gen Z innovation, keynote speaking, and the High-Tech Heroes book series.”).
   - Add services with brief bullet descriptions (each ≤300 characters).
   - Upload logo, cover, and at least five high-quality photos (book, events, author portrait).
   - Add attributes: “Women-led” or applicable descriptors if accurate; ensure “Online appointments” and “On-site services” reflect availability.
   - Link to booking/contact forms and social profiles from the Google Business dashboard (under “Advanced information” → “Links”).
5. Verification follow-up
   - Monitor the admin email and physical mailbox for Google’s code (postcards arrive in ~5–12 days). If using video verification, prepare to record the office signage, workspace, and business documents as prompted.
   - After verifying, recheck that all contact fields remain published (Google sometimes hides changes until verification completes).
6. Optimise for search visibility
   - Craft the first three Google Posts: e.g., “Meet Pete Dulcamara”, “High-Tech Heroes Book Launch”, “Keynote Speaking on Sustainability”. Include CTA buttons linking back to `hightechheroes.ai`.
   - Enable messaging if a team member can respond within 24 hours; otherwise leave disabled to avoid SLA issues.
   - Request initial reviews from trusted partners once the profile is live; provide them target keywords (“sustainability keynote speaker”, “Gen Z innovation”) to weave naturally into testimonials.
   - Add Q&A entries seeded from High-Tech Heroes FAQ. Example: “What is Humanity-Centric Innovation?” with an answer referencing Pete as the originator of the term.
7. Ongoing maintenance
   - Schedule monthly photo uploads (event highlights, behind-the-scenes from speaking engagements).
   - Post updates for each new keynote, media feature, or community milestone.
   - Track insights within the Google Business dashboard; export queries to feed into keyword optimisation (#11).
   - Revisit categories and services quarterly, ensuring alignment with evolving offerings (e.g., new workshop themes or partnerships).
