                        homes for nearly a year. We just couldn't find anything that both of us loved. We were introduced to Carolina and within 6 weeks
                        had an offer accepted on a home that met ALL of our needs with in an amazing neighborhood. She really took the time to get to know
                        us, designing the perfect search process. She was responsive, thoughtful, and extremely prepared for every conversation we had.
                        She was an expert negotiator, and an amazing advocate for us. She went above and beyond the scope of a real estate broker and
                        truly became our trusted advisor. I have the highest appreciation for her work, and would absolutely recommend to anyone looking
                        to find the best home for their family.”

                        like we were right there with her with how detailed orientated she was. Carolina was professional, had great communication, knew
                        the market very well and always had our best interest at heart. She also provided local and trusted contacts for any repairs or
                        upgrades we wanted to do with the house. Without Carolina the process would’ve been far different and we were very glad to have

                        “My wife and I bought our home in March 2021 with Carolina as our realtor. We knew going into our search that we would be
                        particularly challenging buyers: We were relocating to Charlotte from Philadelphia, in the middle of a global pandemic, in one
                        of the craziest housing markets ever. Oh and we're also very picky people. Carolina put up with our nitpicking and indecisiveness
                        the whole way, and found us the perfect house, and she made the process incredibly easy! We had been to the Charlotte area a few
                        years prior, but weren't able to travel for our home search due to COVID and the sheer distance of our move. Carolina was able to
                        call us and use Facetime as she toured the houses, recorded video for us, and explained everything we needed to know about the
                        neighborhoods and surrounding areas. She showed great knowledge of the area, the market, and the current trends with offers that
                        were being accepted. Her expertise gave us an edge, and we were so happy to get our offer accepted on the property we now call our
                        home. We're incredibly lucky to have found Carolina and would recommend her to anyone who needs to buy or sell in the Charlotte
                        area.”
