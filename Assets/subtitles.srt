Hi, I'm Pete Dulcamara. I'm the author of

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,480
High Tech Heroes, Why Gen. Z is the

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,000
Last and Best Chance to Save the Planet.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,680
And I wrote this book based on my 40

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,280
years in science and technology. You

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,040
know, I've got degrees in chemistry,

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,520
math, physics, chemical engineering. I

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,840
spent 17 years at Dow Chemical as an

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,640
executive in R&D, 17 years at

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,960
Kimberly-Clark as chief scientist.

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,080
And now I'm doing in my renaissance, not

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,520
my retirement, but my renaissance. And

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,240
it's all about helping to create

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,880
businesses that improve people's lives.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,560
Innovation is multiplying faster than

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,040
ever.

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,000
The world 100 years ago.

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,240
The world today.

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,640
We are the first generation to.

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,240
How is our world changing?

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,760
Populations are becoming digital.

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,280
Half our life is spent online.

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,000
Less babies are being born.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,040
People are living longer.

25
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,920
The world is aging.

26
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,120
The world is urbanizing.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,560
Consumption is outstripping

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,720
resources. How can we

29
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,400
adapt?

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,280
The time has come for

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,360
exponential technologies.

32
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,880
Your time has come.

33
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,280
Humans like you are joining the

34
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,560
innovation revolution,

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,760
offering real solutions.

36
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,240
People from all generations have heard

37
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,960
the call,

38
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,960
but your generation is

39
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,720
special.
